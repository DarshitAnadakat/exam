A. Save MIT WPU Computer Science Lab
time limit per test1 s.
memory limit per test256 MB
Oh no! The computer servers in MIT WPU's engineering lab are running out of memory during a critical project submission day! As a brilliant engineering student, you’ve been tasked with saving the day by uploading some of your own RAM to keep the system running.

You need to upload n
 GB of RAM to the servers. Each second, you can contribute either 0
 GB or 1
 GB of RAM. However, there’s a restriction due to the campus network's bandwidth: in any k
 consecutive seconds, the network can handle uploading at most 1
 GB of RAM.

Your goal is to figure out the minimum number of seconds required to successfully upload n
 GB of RAM while adhering to the bandwidth restriction.

Can you ensure the servers at MIT WPU continue to function smoothly?

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n
 and k
 (1≤n,k≤100
) — the number of GBs that you want to upload and the length of the time window respectively.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of seconds needed to upload n
 GBs of RAM.

Note
In the first test case, you can upload 1
 GB of RAM per second, so to upload 5
 GBs, you need 5
 seconds.

In the second test case, you can upload 1
 GB in the first second, 0
 GBs in the second second, and 1
 GB in the third second, which in total adds up to exactly 2
 GBs of uploaded RAM.

In the third test case, you can upload 1
 GB in the first second, 0
 GBs in the second second, 0
 GBs in the third second, and 1
 GB in the fourth second, which in total adds up to exactly 2
 GBs of uploaded RAM.
